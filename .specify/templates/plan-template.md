# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

All features MUST comply with the project constitution (.specify/memory/constitution.md). Verify the following before proceeding:

**I. TypeScript Strictness**:
- [ ] No `any` types planned in implementation
- [ ] All new functions will have explicit return types
- [ ] All new components will have typed props interfaces

**II. Test-First Development**:
- [ ] Test strategy defined (unit, integration, e2e scope)
- [ ] TDD approach confirmed (tests written before implementation)
- [ ] Coverage targets identified (80% services, 60% components)

**III. Performance-First Architecture**:
- [ ] Performance impact assessed (bundle size, API latency)
- [ ] Code splitting strategy defined for new routes
- [ ] Database indexes planned for new queries
- [ ] Caching strategy identified if applicable

**IV. User Experience Consistency**:
- [ ] Loading states designed for all async operations
- [ ] Error handling patterns defined with actionable messages
- [ ] Success feedback specified (toasts, visual confirmation)
- [ ] Responsive design considered (mobile-first approach)
- [ ] Accessibility requirements identified (keyboard nav, ARIA)

**V. Security-First Development**:
- [ ] Input validation strategy defined (client + server)
- [ ] Authentication/authorization requirements clear
- [ ] Data sensitivity assessed (PII, payment data)
- [ ] OWASP top 10 risks reviewed for feature

**Complexity Violations** (if any, document below in Complexity Tracking table)

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
