/speckit.specify Build a personalized roadmap generator that creates a customized action plan based on user diagnosis results. When users complete the career diagnosis, the system analyzes their job family, experience level, language proficiency, and target city to generate a tailored roadmap with 10-15 actionable tasks. Tasks are categorized into Learning (skill development), Application (resume, job search), Preparation (interviews, language), and Settlement (visa, relocation). Each task includes a title, description, estimated time to complete, priority level, and recommended completion order. The roadmap displays as a Kanban board with columns for To Do, In Progress, and Completed. Users can drag-and-drop tasks between columns, add custom tasks, edit task details, and mark tasks complete with a checkbox. The system tracks progress percentage and suggests next steps when users complete milestones.
