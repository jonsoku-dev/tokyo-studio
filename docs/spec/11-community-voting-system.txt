/speckit.specify Build a voting system where users can upvote or downvote community posts and comments to surface the most helpful content. Each post and comment displays a vote score (upvotes minus downvotes) with up/down arrow buttons. Users can vote once per item and can change their vote at any time. Posts with high scores appear at the top of lists (Best sorting) while newest posts appear in chronological order (Recent sorting). Users who contribute highly-voted content earn reputation points that unlock privileges like editing others' posts or moderating. The system prevents vote manipulation by rate limiting votes to 100 per day per user and detecting suspicious voting patterns. Vote counts update in real-time without page refresh.
