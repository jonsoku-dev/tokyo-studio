/speckit.specify Build a public profile system where users can showcase their career journey and platform activity. Each user gets a unique profile URL (e.g., /profile/username) that displays their avatar, bio, job family, experience level, language skills, and location. Public profiles show badges earned from completing tasks, number of mentor sessions attended, community posts written, and helpful comments. Users control privacy settings to hide specific information like email, full name, or activity history. Mentors have enhanced profiles showing their company, years of experience, hourly rate, average rating, total sessions completed, and recent reviews. Profile pages are SEO-optimized with Open Graph tags for sharing on social media.
