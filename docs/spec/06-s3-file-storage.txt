/speckit.specify Build a secure cloud file storage system for user documents including resumes, CVs, portfolios, and cover letters. Users upload files directly from their browser to cloud storage without server relay using presigned URLs for security. The system enforces file type validation (PDF, DOCX, TXT only), maximum file size of 10MB per file, and total storage quota of 100MB per user. Each file is assigned a unique identifier and stored with metadata including original filename, file size, upload date, and document type. Users cannot access other users' files even if they know the file URL. The system automatically generates thumbnail previews for PDF files and tracks download counts for analytics.
