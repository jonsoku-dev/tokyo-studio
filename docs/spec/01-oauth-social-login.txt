/speckit.specify Build a social authentication system that allows users to sign up and log in using their Google or GitHub accounts. Users should be able to link multiple social accounts to a single platform account. The system must verify email ownership and create user profiles automatically from social account data including name, email, and profile picture. When a user logs in, they should see a unified dashboard regardless of which authentication method they used. Existing users who previously registered with email/password should be able to link their social accounts. The system must prevent duplicate accounts by matching email addresses and handle edge cases where social providers don't share email addresses.
