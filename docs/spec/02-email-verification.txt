/speckit.specify Build an email verification system that sends a confirmation link to users when they sign up with email/password. Users receive a welcome email with a verification link that expires after 24 hours. Until they verify their email, users see a banner reminding them to check their inbox and can request a new verification link. Verified users get a badge on their profile. The system must prevent brute force attacks by rate limiting verification email requests to 3 per hour per email address. Verification tokens must be cryptographically secure and single-use only.
