/speckit.specify Build a profile management system where users can upload and customize their profile picture (avatar). Users can upload images from their device or drag-and-drop files. The system displays a cropping interface where users can select the desired area in a circular frame. Uploaded images are automatically resized to 200x200px for display and 800x800px for high-resolution viewing. Supported formats are JPG, PNG, and WebP with a maximum file size of 5MB. Users can delete their avatar to revert to a default generated avatar based on their initials. The system must prevent uploading of inappropriate images and validate file types on both client and server.
