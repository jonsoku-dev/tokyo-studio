/speckit.specify Build a threaded comment system for community posts where users can have nested discussions up to 3 levels deep. Users can reply to any comment, and replies are visually indented to show the conversation hierarchy. Each comment shows the author's avatar, name, timestamp, and content with Markdown formatting support. Users can edit their own comments within 15 minutes of posting (with an "edited" indicator), delete their comments (with confirmation), and report inappropriate comments. Comments display vote counts (upvotes minus downvotes) and users can vote once per comment. The system collapses deeply nested threads with a "Show more replies" button. Users receive notifications when someone replies to their comment or mentions them with @username syntax.
