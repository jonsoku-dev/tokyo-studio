/speckit.specify Build a password reset flow where users who forgot their password can request a reset link via email. Users enter their email address and receive a secure reset link that expires after 1 hour. The reset page allows them to enter a new password with strength requirements (minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase, one lowercase, one number). The system must invalidate all existing reset tokens when a password is successfully changed. Rate limiting prevents abuse by allowing only 3 reset requests per hour per email address. Users are notified via email when their password is changed as a security measure.
