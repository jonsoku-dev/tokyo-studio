/speckit.specify Build a full-text search system for community posts where users can find relevant discussions quickly. The search bar is prominently displayed at the top of the community page with autocomplete suggestions as users type. Search results rank posts by relevance (keyword matching, title weight, recency) and display snippets highlighting matching keywords. Users can filter results by category (Interview Review, QnA, General Discussion), date range (Last Week, Last Month, Last Year), and tags. Advanced search supports operators like quotes for exact phrases, minus sign to exclude terms, and OR for alternatives. The system indexes post titles, content, author names, and tags for comprehensive search. Search queries are logged anonymously to improve ranking algorithms and suggest trending topics.
