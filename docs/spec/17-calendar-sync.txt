/speckit.specify Build a Google Calendar integration where users can sync their roadmap tasks, mentor sessions, and application deadlines with their personal calendar. Users authorize the platform to access their Google Calendar via OAuth, selecting which calendar to sync with. Roadmap tasks with due dates automatically create calendar events with task title, description, and due time. Mentor sessions create calendar events with meeting links, duration, and mentor information. Job application deadlines create reminder events 1 day before and on the deadline day. Changes made in the platform (task completed, session rescheduled, deadline updated) automatically sync to Google Calendar within 5 minutes. Users can disconnect the integration at any time, which removes all synced events. The system supports two-way sync where tasks completed in Google Calendar are marked complete in the platform.
