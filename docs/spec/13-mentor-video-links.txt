/speckit.specify Build an automatic video meeting link generation system for mentor sessions. When a session is booked and payment is confirmed, the system automatically generates a unique Google Meet or Zoom meeting link and adds it to the session details. Both the mentor and mentee receive calendar invites (ICS files) via email containing the meeting link, session topic, duration, and participant information. The meeting link is also displayed on the session details page in both users' dashboards. Reminders are sent 24 hours before and 1 hour before the session with a quick link to join the meeting. The system supports timezone conversion to show meeting times in each participant's local timezone. Meeting links expire 2 hours after the scheduled session end time for security.
