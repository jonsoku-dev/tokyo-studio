/speckit.specify Build a document management interface where users organize their career documents by type and version. The main page displays documents in a grid layout with thumbnail previews, document name, type (Resume/CV/Portfolio/Cover Letter), version status (Draft/Final), file size, and upload date. Users can upload new documents via drag-and-drop or file picker, rename documents, mark versions as draft or final, download originals, and delete documents. A built-in PDF viewer allows users to preview documents without downloading, with zoom controls and page navigation. Users can search documents by name or filter by type and status. The system tracks version history showing when documents were uploaded, modified, or marked as final.
