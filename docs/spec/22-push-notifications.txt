/speckit.specify Build a browser push notification system that keeps users engaged with timely updates. Users are prompted to enable notifications on their first visit with a clear explanation of benefits (session reminders, application deadlines, community replies). Once enabled, users receive notifications for important events: mentor session starting in 1 hour, job application deadline tomorrow, someone replied to your community post, mentor accepted your booking, payment completed, roadmap task due today, and weekly summary of platform activity. Each notification includes a title, message, icon, and click action that opens the relevant page. Users can customize notification preferences in settings, choosing which types to receive and quiet hours (e.g., no notifications between 10 PM - 8 AM). The system respects browser notification permissions and handles cases where users block or revoke permissions. Notifications are sent via the Push API for web browsers and work even when the platform tab is closed. Undelivered notifications (when user is offline) are queued and delivered when they come back online.
