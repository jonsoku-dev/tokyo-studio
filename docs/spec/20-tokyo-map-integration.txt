/speckit.specify Build an interactive Tokyo map showing key locations for settlement and daily life. The map displays markers for important places including city halls (Shibuya, Shinjuku, Minato, etc.), immigration offices, major banks (SMBC, MUFG, Mizuho), mobile carriers (Docomo, Softbank, au), popular housing areas (Shibuya, Nakameguro, Ebisu, Meguro), and convenience stores for administrative tasks (7-Eleven, Family Mart with multi-copy machines). Each marker shows the location name in English, Japanese, and Korean with address, phone number, business hours, and nearest train station. Users can filter markers by category (Government, Banking, Housing, Mobile, Shopping) and search for specific locations. The map integrates with Google Maps to show walking/transit directions from the user's current location. Users can save favorite locations and add custom markers with notes. The system defaults to showing locations in central Tokyo but allows users to search other areas if they plan to live outside the city center.
