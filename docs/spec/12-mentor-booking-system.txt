/speckit.specify Build a mentor booking system where users can browse available mentors, view their calendars, and book 1-on-1 sessions. The mentor directory displays cards with avatar, name, current company, job title, years of experience, hourly rate, average rating, and total sessions completed. Users can filter mentors by job family (Frontend, Backend, Mobile, etc.), experience level, availability, and price range. Clicking a mentor shows their full profile with detailed bio, areas of expertise, availability calendar, and recent reviews. Users select an available time slot (shown in their local timezone), choose session duration (30min, 60min, 90min), write a brief description of what they want to discuss, and confirm payment. The system prevents double-booking by locking time slots during checkout and sends confirmation emails to both parties with session details.
