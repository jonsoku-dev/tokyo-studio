/speckit.specify Build a mentor application workflow where users can apply to become platform mentors. The application form collects current job title, company name, years of IT experience in Japan, LinkedIn profile URL, areas of expertise (Frontend, Backend, Mobile, etc.), languages spoken, preferred hourly rate, and a detailed bio explaining why they want to mentor. Applicants upload a verification document (company ID badge or recent payslip with sensitive info redacted) to prove employment. Applications are submitted to an admin review queue where admins can approve, reject with feedback, or request additional information. Approved applicants receive an email notification and their account is upgraded to mentor status, unlocking the availability scheduler and profile customization. Rejected applicants can reapply after 30 days. The system tracks application status (Pending, Under Review, Approved, Rejected) and displays it on the applicant's dashboard.
