/speckit.specify Build an SEO optimization system that improves search engine visibility for the platform. Each page should have unique, descriptive meta titles (under 60 characters) and meta descriptions (under 160 characters) that include relevant keywords like "Japan IT jobs," "Tokyo software engineer," "Korean developers in Japan," etc. Public pages like mentor profiles, community posts, and the homepage should have Open Graph tags for rich social media previews when shared on Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. The system automatically generates a sitemap.xml file listing all public URLs, updated daily as new content is published. A robots.txt file guides search engine crawlers to index public content while excluding admin pages and user dashboards. Page load performance is optimized with lazy loading images, minified CSS/JS bundles, and server-side rendering for critical content. Structured data (JSON-LD) marks up mentor profiles, reviews, and job postings for rich search results. The system tracks core web vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) and alerts when performance degrades.
