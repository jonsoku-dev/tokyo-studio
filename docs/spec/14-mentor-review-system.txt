/speckit.specify Build a post-session review system where mentees can rate their experience and provide feedback. After a session ends, mentees receive an email prompting them to leave a review within 7 days. Reviews consist of a 5-star rating (required) and written feedback (optional) covering aspects like helpfulness, expertise, communication, and value for money. Mentees can remain anonymous or attach their name to the review. Mentors can respond to reviews to thank mentees or clarify feedback. Reviews are displayed on mentor profile pages sorted by recency with the ability to filter by rating. The system calculates average ratings weighted by recency (more weight to recent reviews) and displays badges for top-rated mentors (4.8+ stars with 10+ reviews). Inappropriate reviews can be flagged and removed by admins. Mentors cannot delete negative reviews but can dispute them for admin review.
